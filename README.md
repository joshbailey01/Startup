### Pitch
    After interviewing university strudents across several campuses we found that the majority feel 
    like they don't always know whats happening in the social scene. Turnt solves this problem. 
    It is a wesbsite/app where people post, share, and save local parties. It alows people to see events 
    happening near their area, can generate more business for DJ's and small pop up shops, and 
    eliminates FOMO on college campuses.

### Features
    Secure login
    Search algorithm
    Share button that copies a link
    Save button that saves a post to your collection

### Technologies
    **Authentication** - option to create an account adds user to database, login generates authtoken, username is displayed after login.
    **Database** - stores users and user data (hashes of saved posts), stores posts
    **Websocket data** - Notification center, notifications are sent to owner of post when their post is saved.
